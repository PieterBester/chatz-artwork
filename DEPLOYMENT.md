## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**:

   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

2. **App Not Loading**:
   - Check if the service is running (green status)
   - Verify the start command is correct
   - Check environment variables

3. **Image Processing Issues**:
   - Ensure the app has sufficient memory
   - Consider upgrading to a paid plan for better performance
   - Check browser console for client-side errors

4. **Slow Performance**:
   - Free tier has limited resources
   - Consider upgrading to Standard plan
   - Optimize image sizes before upload

### Getting Help

1. **Render Support**:
   - Check Render documentation
   - Contact Render support for platform issues

2. **App Issues**:
   - Check the logs in Render dashboard
   - Review the code in `src/lib/imageProcessor.ts`
   - Test locally first: `npm run dev`

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Don't commit sensitive data to Git
   - Use Render's environment variable system

2. **File Uploads**:
   - The app processes images client-side
   - No server-side file storage
   - Images are processed in the browser

3. **Access Control**:
   - Consider adding authentication if needed
   - The app is currently public (no login required)

## Cost Considerations

- Cold start takes ~30 seconds
- Perfect for personal/small business use

### Render Paid Plans
- Always-on service

## Next Steps

2. **Test thoroughly** with your actual artwork
3. **Share the URL** with your team
4. **Monitor usage** and upgrade if needed
5. **Add custom domain** for professional appearance
